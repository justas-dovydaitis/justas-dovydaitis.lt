## About

### Profession

Currently, I am a freelance full-stack developer and looking for a full-time front-end developer job. By job I mean, not just a job, but also an environment in which I could continually improve my professional and human skills. As a programmer, I value clean and quality code the most. Because of that, I am always trying to provide a clean and reasonable code event if it will cost extra time for me.

#### Stack:

-   Javascript / Typescript / ReactJS / Angular / NodeJS
-   CSS / SCSS
-   HTML
-   C# / .NET / ASP.NET / WPF
-   C++ / Arduino
-   MySQL / SQLite / MongoDB

### Hobbies & Interests

#### Motorcycles

I love motorcycles and the culture of riders. It is and integral part of my life and It is starting to be more than just a hobby. It is now more like a lifestyle. The wind, engine roaring, acceleration, freedom, and a tiny bit of adrenaline are just enough to make me smile even after the worst day.

#### Music

Like many other people, I can't imagine life without music. I believe that music can tell some things about a person.
I usually vibe on rock, R&B, soul, funk, disco, and jazz (usually instrumental music) but it can variate depending on the mood.
Mostly listening to older music. The '80s is my favorite decade but it can variate around two decades up and down also.

I am always open to share my playlists on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/11148697856?si=4c4181ea13464df6)
