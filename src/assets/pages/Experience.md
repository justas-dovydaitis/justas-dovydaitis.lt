## Experience

### Visma Lietuva - Front-end Internship

_(2020-02-02 - 2020-03-27)_

I have made big progress during these two months. Starting with the strong fundamentals of front-end development, ending team project using Angular framework. I had two coolest mentors which shared their experience as much as they could. They trained me to respect, appreciate and produce clean and quality code.

### Freelancing Gigs

_(since 2019)_

I've done some freelancing gigs. Most of them are small. Usually, I fix problems with websites (mostly WordPress) or create custom themes and elements. Because of the big competition between WordPress developers and lack of having regular customers sometimes it is hard to get a gig.
Otherwise, sometimes I get more interesting projects. A few of them are:

- #### Jetski Race Lap Timer App

    _(2021)_

    One of the recent projects. A windows application to make jetski race referee work easier. Requested by [Lithuanian Federation of Jetski sports](https://lvmsf.lt/). It was built using __C#__ programming language, __WPF (_Windows Presentation Foundation_)__ framework and __SQLite__ database. 

    Features: 
    - Participant registration and management.
    - Importing Participants from past events.
    - Qualification calculation.
    - Lap taking.
    - Penalty setting.
    - Reports printing.
    - Combining different race classes into one.
    - Live results presentation.
   

- #### Orienteering Game Web App
    _(2019)_

    It is one of the earliest projects as a freelance developer. The project was requested by the [Ringaudai Community Center](https://ringaudai.eu/). Idea was to create a "[Å turmas](https://www.sturmas.lt/)" style app that shows participants a list of tasks (riddles). Participants should solve a riddle get to the right place. Then take a photo of himself (or themselves if it is a team) and upload it to the system. After the time is up it shows all answers, scores, mistakes, leaderboards. The administrator's part is to rate and ban participants and supervise the game. 

    
    Project is created using __React__ and __Django__ frameworks connected using __REST API__.
