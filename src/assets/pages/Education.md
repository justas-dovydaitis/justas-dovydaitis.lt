### Kaunas University of Technology

_(2016-09-01 - Now)_

I've started my software engineering studies with no knowledge about programming. I just knew that I like computers and tech. There was a variety of subjects that I learned over those years in university. Starting basic object-oriented programming and ending teamwork concepts. Studies developed not only software engineering skills but also soft skills like time management and responsibility. I do not have a degree yet, but I will have one in 2022.
